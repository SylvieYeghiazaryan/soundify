## Setup Instructions

### Frontend Setup (React.js)

To set up the **frontend** and run the React.js application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the **music-recommendation-frontend** directory and run the following command to install the necessary node modules:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Application:**
   Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the React application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React development server, and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### Backend Setup (Django)

To set up the **music-recommendation-backend** and run the Django server, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
   Go to the **music_backend** directory where the `manage.py` file is located.

2. **Configure Python Interpreter:**
   Ensure that your Python interpreter is configured to the correct version (Python 3.9+). If you're using an IDE like PyCharm, you can set the interpreter there.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   It's a good practice to use a virtual environment. Create one by running:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Then activate it:

   * On **Windows**:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   * On **MacOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required libraries from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Backend:**
   To start the Django development server, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The backend server will now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

Now, the frontend and backend should be running, and you can interact with the AI-powered music recommendation system using your Spotify data!
